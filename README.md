# Scraping top 100 movies page of The Pirate Bay

It gets all top 100 movies and adds information about the movie using the OMDB API. I decided to use OMDB because it is nice and fast, at least faster than imdbpy. You need an API-key from OMDB to make this work and are allowed 1000 requests a day for free. More info: https://www.omdbapi.com/

I've added movie info such as:
- Genre
- Plot
- Rating
- Metascore
- Votes
